To showcase my Machine Learning hands on Projects
Here's a well-structured project description for your GitHub README:

# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the famous **Titanic Dataset**, applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to predict survival outcomes.

## 🔍 Key Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values using mean imputation  
   - Removing outliers based on standard deviation  
   - Encoding categorical features  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizing distributions using seaborn & matplotlib  
   - Feature correlation analysis  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating new features (e.g., FamilySize)  
   - Scaling numerical data using MinMaxScaler & StandardScaler  

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   - Training ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest  
   - Evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

5. **Conclusion & Insights**  
   - Summary of findings and model effectiveness  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  
- Deploying the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-world applications
